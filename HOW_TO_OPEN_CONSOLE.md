# How to Open Chrome Console (Developer Tools)

## Quick Method:
1. **Press `F12`** on your keyboard
2. OR **Right-click anywhere on the page** → Select **"Inspect"** or **"Inspect Element"**
3. OR **Press `Ctrl+Shift+I`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd+Option+I`** (Mac)

## After Opening:
1. Look for tabs at the top: **Elements**, **Console**, **Sources**, **Network**, etc.
2. Click the **"Console"** tab
3. You'll see all the logs there!

## What You'll See:
- Logs starting with `===` (our debug logs)
- Any errors in red
- Success messages in green/black

## Alternative - Use the Yellow Debug Box:
- **You don't need the console anymore!**
- The yellow debug box at the top of the User Management page shows:
  - Existing Users count
  - Azure AD Users count
  - Loading status
  - All without opening console!

After opening console, type:
```
userManagementDebug
```
And press Enter to see all the data!
